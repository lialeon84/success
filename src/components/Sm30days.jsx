                <p>What I noticed on the first few days without social media was that time went by slower. 
                   I had nothing to distract me. There was nothing filling in the gaps of every minute of my day.
                   There was a sense of emptiness and urge to check Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and TikTok.
                   As if I was missing out on something important. I had to put all of my mental strength not to check.
                </p>
                <p> I had to do something about this empty feeling. What did I do with all of this time social media wasn't taking 
                    from me? I focus my attention on other things that I had procrastinated on. I read books that I had in my bookshelf 
                    that were collecting dust. I listen to my audio books I left half way. I picked up a new class and focus more on my 
                    React project.
                </p>
                <p> The less time I spent on social media the better I felt. I didn't feel pulled into a 100 
                different directions from everyone calling my attention. I didn't feel responsible for others. 
                I didn't have to see or hear nerve racking news every minute of the day. I didn't feel pressure 
                to share parts of myself. I wasn't criticized or attacked for sharing my thoughts. Time was about me. 
                It was about feeling centered and less anxious.
                </p>
                <p> The urge to over extend myself and post everything I saw and heard wasn't there anymore. I had time to 
                focus and really enjoy just relaxing. To enjoy that cup of coffee without reading about news. 
                It really was about me and about preserving my energy. I learned that I should really be more prudent 
                with my time and my energy.
