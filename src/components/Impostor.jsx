                <p>In today's society there's a lot of pressure to achieve success and can drive us to over do it. 
                   And because of that pressure we may blur healthy boundaries. Pressuring ourselves to over work 
                   and get things done fast can lead to burnout and bad memory. 
                </p>
                <p> As we step up the ladder of success it will do us good to work with managers, agents, family, friends 
                    or even an assistant who can say No or Yes on our behalf. People who can help us set structures that 
                    are required to succeed. Even when we go through periods where we simply feel lost about 
                    our professional direction. 
                </p>
                <p> How can this help you fight impostor syndrome? By surrounding yourself with supporters who 
                    bolster your confidence can help you stay on purpose-driven even when you want to run away or sabotage
                    your well-deserved success. But what will truly help us is when we stop comparing ourselves to others.
                    When we stop seeking validation that we are good enough for the career that we want. When we decide we are
                    in charge of our own validation.
                </p>
                <p> Stop expecting perfection from yourself when you're learn anything new. Comparing ourselves is what causes 
                    impostor syndrome. Nothing good comes from comparing ourselves and despairing on those differences. Next time
                    you start comparing yourself, stop what you're doing, take a deep breathe and say; I am good enough. I am good enough where 
                    I'm at and I will get better. I will get there soon enough.
                </p>
                <p>The truth is nothing is stopping anyone from reaching the level of success. What stops us is ourselves.
                    What we believe about us. How smart we think we are. How pretty we think we are. All of these limitations 
                    are set by our own minds. The lies we tell ourselves day in and day out. Social media has done it's part
                    ripping us apart. Dissecting us piece by piece making us feel less worthy of what we want. Don't let anything
                    get into your head where you stop believing in yourself. Everyday look in the mirror and say; I am good enough.
                    Never stop believing in yourself. Your future self will thank you. You will look back and say; I am happy I 
                    didn't give up or believe I wasn't good enough.
