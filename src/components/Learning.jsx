                <p>One of the things I learn in this article is what to do when you're stuck in overthinking.
                    He called it Focused and Diffuse thinking. You to focus for 25mins and then do some kind of 
                    reward system that will make you go into diffuse thinking. For example reward yourself with a
                    coffee break, take a walk, play a simple game and so on to take the mind off focus mode.
