                    He called it Focused and Diffuse thinking. You would focus for 25mins and then do some kind of 
                    reward system. One that will make you go into diffuse thinking. For example, reward yourself with a
                    coffee break, take a walk, play a simple game, anything to take the mind off focus mode.
                </p></li>

                    <li></li>
                </ul>

                
                <p>When learning something new take day breaks like you would when you have an exercise routine. Lets say 
                    you study Monday's, Wednesday's and Friday's and the other days are for resting and doing other things.
