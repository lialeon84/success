             <hr></hr>
                <p>One of the things I learn from this article is, what to do when you're stuck in overthinking.
                    He called it Focused and Diffuse thinking. You would focus for 25mins and then do some kind of 
                    reward system. One that will make you go into diffuse thinking. For example, reward yourself with a
                    coffee break, take a walk, play a simple game, anything to take the mind off focus mode. Zooming 
                    in and out of a problem can give you a bigger perspective. 
                </p>
                
                <p>When learning something new take day breaks like you would when you have an exercise routine. Lets say 
                    you study Monday's, Wednesday's and Friday's and the other days are for resting and doing other things.
                    If you read or study before going to bed it will help you dream about it and if you say you want to dream 
                    about it you could dream of what you have ready or studied.
                </p>

                <p>When learning something boring ask questions about it which in turn will activate interest. You learn more 
                    by active engagement then by passive listening. Exercising will help create new neuron connection that helps
                    memory and keeps the mind healthy. The brain starts generating new ideas in diffuse thinking, to activate 
                    diffuse thinking simply take a walk. Make sure to take your phone or notepad with you to write down your ideas.
                </p>

                <p>To avoid getting burnout when you want to study or work for long periods of time is to take breaks periodically. 
                    If you're going to study or work for six days straight make sure to take the seventh day off. Repeat this process 
                    for four weeks and then take 5 days off. If you don't take any breaks for three months straight this is when
                    you will start to experience burnout, your brain will refuse new memories and you will have a harder time 
                    focusing.
